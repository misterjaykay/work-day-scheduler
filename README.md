## Overview (Contents)

This is Homework 5 - Work Day Scheduler

In this homework, I created an app(page) that give you a full working day scheduler, that user can input what event they have in certain hours during their work hours.

When you first open this app(page), you will see the current time and date.

```(Optional. You can also make time clock live, so that the current time and date will be automatically updated to current time and date.)```

This app(page) give you timeblocks for each business hours for user to use.

After writing any events and click submit button at the right, it will be saved into your local storage.

Whenever you re-open this app(page), you will still see what you previously filled events.
